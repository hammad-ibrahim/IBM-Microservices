# Using POSTMAN to test the REST API endpoints
 
 - While the GET endpoints are easy to test with curl using a command line interface, the POST, PUT and DELETE commands can be cumbersome. To circumvent this problem, you can use Postman, which is a software that is available as a service.

 - Postman will need remote access to the server as it is an external entity. To get the URL click the following button.

 - Launch Application

 - Copy the URL into a notepad or other text editors. Go to https://www.postman.com/ and sign up before you start using POSTMAN.

 - Click Create New to start creating a request to the REST API endpoint.
