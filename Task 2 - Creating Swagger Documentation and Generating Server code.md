 # Task 2 - Creating Swagger Documentation and Generating Server code
        Now you will create a REST API with Swagger documentation. To start with, letâ€™s define your application.
        It will adhere to Swagger 2.0 version
        This is the first version of the application
        It will have one endpoint /greetings, which returns the list of greetings as a JSON object.
        Copy and paste the following JSON in the Swagger Editor. You will get a prompt which says Would you like to convert your JSON into YAML? . Press Cancel to paste the content.

```json
{
    "swagger": "2.0",
    "info": {
      "version": "1.0",
      "title": "Our first generated REST API",
      "description": "<h2>This is a sample server code the is generated from Swagger Documenation with Swagger Editor</h2>"
    },

    "paths": {
      "/greetings": {
        "get": {
          "summary": "Returns a list of Greetings",
          "tags": ["Hello in Different Languages"],
          "description": "Returns greetings in different languages",
          "produces": [
            "application/json"
          ],
          "responses": {
            "200": {
              "description": "OK"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
}
```

 - You will see the Swagger UI automatically appearing on the right. You cannot test it yet as your application is not defined and running yet.

        From the menu on top, click on Generate Server and select python-flask.
        This will automatically generate the server code as a zip file named python-flask-server-generated.zip. 
        Download the zip file to your system.

 - Check to see if the zip file that you just dragged and dropped, exists.

```bash
ls python-flask-server-generated.zip
```

- Unzip the contents of the zip file into a directory named python-flask-server-generated by running the following command.
```bash
unzip python-flask-server-generated.zip -d python-flask-server-generated/
```

 - Change to the python-flask-server folder inside the folder you just extracted the zip file into.
```bash
cd python-flask-server-generated/python-flask-server
```
